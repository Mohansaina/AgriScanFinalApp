## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AgriScantotal
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/agriscan-frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd ../../backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on http://localhost:5000

2. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/agriscan-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

### Testing the APIs

Run the provided test script:
```bash
cd AgriScantotal
node test/api.test.js
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Check if the backend is running
- `POST /api/ocr` - Process pesticide label image (OCR)
- `POST /api/dosage` - Calculate pesticide dosage
- `GET /api/weather` - Get weather data for a location

## Sample Data for Testing

### OCR Testing
Use the sample pesticide label in `samples/pesticide_label_sample.txt`

### Dosage Calculation
Example inputs:
- Crop Type: Wheat
- Field Size: 5.5 hectares
- Recommended Dosage: 1.5 L/hectare

### Weather API
The weather API simulates conditions and provides safety recommendations

## Deployment

Refer to `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions for:
- Vercel (Frontend)
- Render (Backend)
- Single application deployment
- CI/CD pipeline setup
